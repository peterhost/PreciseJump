PreciseJump aka '[count] motion' on drugs

I find
    <number>line-motion
not very practical for bigger <numbers>.

I usually don't know exactly how many times I want the motion to be repeated - I just see place on the screen where I want to jump to.

This script is addressing this inconvenience.

When the motion key is pressed, possible jump targets are highlighted. You just have to type character that appeared on desired place.

i.e: If you press new '_fx' you get all 'x' characters in the line highlighted and changed to
some unique chars. Pressing the highlighted char will take the cursor to place you want.

For little demo you can see:

Plugin definines following mapping:  _f ,  _w ,  _e ,  _t . 

This script is usable right now, but keep in mind that it still is being developed. 
I will apriciate any comments.
